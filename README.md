# LeGM


This React app takes its name from the player LeBron James, who is often referred by online communities as the “general manager” of his team due to the
powerful influence on any franchise he joins. The name “LeGM” can be broken down into two parts: “Le” the first syllable of James’ name, which also means “the” in French, and “GM” an acronym for general manager.

The app's name, LeGM, reflects its purpose of providing meaningful insights from raw data on players and teams to help users make informed decisions about a player's value on a particular team. The app, LeGM, enables users to research and compare any active players and gives them the flexibility to customize the list of attributes they wish to compare.
